## üßë‚Äçüíª Summary
As an MSc Artificial Intelligence graduate from the University of Huddersfield (2023-24), I‚Äôve crafted solutions at the intersection of AI, machine learning, and data-driven technologies. With a focus on deep learning, computer vision, NLP, and Generative AI, I‚Äôve developed real-world systems like a Facial Emotion Recognition tool that achieves 95% accuracy in real-time video analysis.

In my journey, I‚Äôve learned that AI is not just about success ‚Äî it‚Äôs also about learning from failure. I‚Äôve faced challenges such as system crashes during model training, but each setback only deepened my problem-solving abilities. I‚Äôve always believed that every failure is an opportunity for growth, whether it's tweaking model architectures, optimizing data pipelines, or debugging code that didn‚Äôt run as expected. It was during these times that my resilience and creativity came into play, pushing me to keep iterating until success was achieved.

In addition to my technical skills, I‚Äôve embraced every opportunity to grow as a team player and communicator. My time at Sukhothai Restaurant and Amazon Fulfillment Center shaped my soft skills ‚Äî customer interaction, collaboration, and adaptability under pressure ‚Äî especially during Amazon‚Äôs Christmas peak season, where quick learning and agility were critical.

I‚Äôm a 5‚≠êÔ∏è Python coder on HackerRank, always looking for new ways to simplify problems, optimize workflows, and bring efficiency to everything I do. My approach to challenges has always been rooted in innovation and sustainability, striving to create AI solutions that not only work but also make a lasting positive impact.

Looking ahead, I‚Äôm excited to continue learning, exploring new technologies like AgenticAI, and applying my skills in dynamic, forward-thinking teams. Whether it's AI, data analytics, or full-stack development, I‚Äôm ready to make meaningful contributions and tackle new challenges with a creative mindset.
